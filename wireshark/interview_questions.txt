## üß† **Wireshark ‚Äì Interview Questions & Key Concepts**

### **Interview Questions**

**1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Wireshark used for?**
Wireshark is a **network protocol analyzer** used to capture and inspect data packets flowing through a network.
It helps in **network troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and security analysis** by providing detailed insights into network traffic.

---

**2Ô∏è‚É£ What is a packet?**
A packet is a **small unit of data** transmitted over a network.
Each packet contains:

* **Header** (control information: source/destination addresses, protocol info)
* **Payload** (actual data being sent)

---

**3Ô∏è‚É£ How to filter packets in Wireshark?**
You can filter packets using the **display filter bar**.
Examples:

* Show only HTTP traffic ‚Üí `http`
* Show only DNS traffic ‚Üí `dns`
* Show packets from a specific IP ‚Üí `ip.addr == 192.168.1.10`
* Combine filters ‚Üí `http && ip.addr == 8.8.8.8`

**4Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between TCP and UDP?**

| Feature             | TCP                                         | UDP                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Full Form**       | Transmission Control Protocol               | User Datagram Protocol             |
| **Connection Type** | Connection-oriented                         | Connectionless                     |
| **Reliability**     | Reliable (acknowledgements, retransmission) | Unreliable (no delivery guarantee) |
| **Speed**           | Slower                                      | Faster                             |
| **Example Use**     | HTTP, FTP, HTTPS                            | DNS, VoIP, Streaming               |

**5Ô∏è‚É£ What is a DNS query packet?**
A DNS query packet is a network request sent from a client to a **DNS server** to resolve a **domain name (e.g., google.com)** into an **IP address**.
Wireshark shows these under the **DNS protocol**, typically using **UDP port 53**.

---

**6Ô∏è‚É£ How can packet capture help in troubleshooting?**
Packet captures help by:

* Identifying **connectivity issues** (dropped packets, latency)
* Checking **DNS resolution** or **protocol errors**
* Detecting **unauthorized or malicious traffic**
* Analyzing **slow network performance**

Wireshark allows you to see what‚Äôs happening at the **packet level**, making it easier to locate the root cause of network problems.

---

**7Ô∏è‚É£ What is a protocol?**
A protocol is a **set of rules** that define how data is formatted, transmitted, and received across a network.
Examples: **HTTP**, **TCP**, **UDP**, **DNS**, **ICMP**, **ARP**.

---

**8Ô∏è‚É£ Can Wireshark decrypt encrypted traffic?**

* **Yes**, but **only under certain conditions.**
  Wireshark can decrypt:

  * **TLS/SSL traffic** if you have the session keys or server‚Äôs private key.
  * **WPA/WPA2 Wi-Fi traffic** if you know the passphrase and capture the handshake.
    Otherwise, encrypted data (like HTTPS) appears as unreadable ciphertext.

---

### **Key Concepts**

* **Packet Capture:** Process of recording network data packets using tools like Wireshark or tcpdump.
* **Protocol Analysis:** Examining packet contents to understand communication patterns or detect issues.
* **TCP/IP Model:** A 4-layer model (Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access) used for data transmission.
* **Network Troubleshooting:** Diagnosing problems like latency, dropped connections, or incorrect routing using packet data.
* **Filtering:** Using Wireshark filters to narrow down traffic by protocol, IP, or port for efficient analysis.
